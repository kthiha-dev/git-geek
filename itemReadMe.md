  <h2>Rules for Committing Code</h2>

  <h3>1. Commit Messages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin your commit message with a capitalized verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add," "Fix," "Update").</li>
    <li>Keep commit messages concise and descriptive (around 50 characters or less).</li>
    <li>Provide additional details in the commit body if necessary, separating it from the title with a blank line.</li>
    <li>Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature").</li>
  </ul>
